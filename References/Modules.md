# Modules
In unreal engine 4 code is compiled to modules. The main difference between a module and a plugin is organizational.
A plugin is an optional module compiled outside of the game/engine modules and is added in the plugin browser in your project file.

Modules can have any number of dependencies on other modules, in the plugin browser you will be notified when loading/unloading a module which requires another.
